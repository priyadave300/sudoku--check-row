# sudoku-check-row
A function named row_correct(sudoku: list, row_no: int), which takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, and an integer referring to a single row, as its arguments. Rows are indexed from 0.
The function should return True or False, depending on whether the row is filled in correctly, that is, whether it contains each of the numbers 1 to 9 at most once.
